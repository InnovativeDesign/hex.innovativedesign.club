Myles will be leading a workshop on exploring duotone colors in visual design! Duotones is a technique that uses two colors and creates a gradient map over a drawn illustration or profile photo, often creating a playful, vibrant mood. You will become familiar with basic Photoshop skills, learning about black and white levels, contrast, and colors, as well as to freely experiment on their own! 

- Please bring your laptop with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator installed.
