Sheryl and Shenelle will be giving an introduction to HTML and CSS and hopefully a bit of web design as well. Theyâ€™ll be teaching you a very brief overview to these coding languages and how you can use them to make beautiful designs online!

Shenelle and Sheryl are both on the design-focused Web Team for InnoD this semester! Shenelle took the Intro to Ps/Ai DeCal last semester to learn graphic design and is now learning web design on our Web Team.
