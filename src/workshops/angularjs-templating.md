Tired of copy-pasting HTML and CSS? Erik will be teaching you how to repeat website elements to streamline content and style editing using a popular Javascript front-end framework called AngularJS.

* Please bring your laptop for this workshop!
* Prior knowledge of HTML/CSS recommended, but not required
