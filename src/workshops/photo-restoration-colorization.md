Brandon will be teaching a Photoshop workshop on the basics of photo colorization and restoration! He will provide an overview of colorizing black and white photos with color fill layers. He will also highlight powerful Photoshop tools (Spot Healing Brush, Clone Stamp, Smudge, Dodge, Burn...) that will help with restoring missing image data. Youâ€™ll learn how to apply essential photo colorization and restoration techniques, not only in restoration projects, but even in other Photoshop-centric projects that may require use of unfamiliar tools.

- Please bring your laptop with Photoshop installed
- Bring a digital copy of your own physically damaged photo! (optional)
- Beginner friendly

Brandon is a first-year EECS major who learned Photoshop in middle school because he wanted to make memes of his friends. Throughout high school, he continued using Photoshop for numerous projects, ranging from image manipulation to brochure design. Talk to him about volleyball, Frank Ocean, or full-stack development!
