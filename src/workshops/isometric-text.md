Elizabeth will be teaching a lesson on how to make awesome 3D/Isometric text in Illustrator! It involves using the Extrude and Bevel tool and deals a lot with the Appearance panel within Illustrator, so some prior experience with Illustrator is recommended!

* Please bring your laptop with Illustrator installed!
* Intermediate level

Elizabeth is a junior studying Economics and City Planning who loves 
puns, succulents, and Ice Bear from We Bare Bears (great show, go check it out). Check out some of her design work here <https://www.elizabethzhou.com/>!
